    <p>Hi, I'm Lisa! I'm a senior at Cornell University studying
    <a class = "links" href = "https://www.infosci.cornell.edu/" target = "_blank">Information Science</a>
    with a minor in Law and Society.</p>
    <p>In school, I serve as a Product Designer on the
    <a class = "links" href="http://cornelldti.org/" target = "_blank">Cornell Design & Tech Initiative</a>
    project team, which creates apps and websites for the Cornell community. On the team, I am currently designing
    an app called <a class = "links" href="https://www.cornelldti.org/Projects/events" target = "_blank">cue</a>
    which will make on-campus events more discoverable for students.</p>
    <p>In school, I have helped to teach
    <a class = "links" href = "https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/FA19/class/INFO/4240" target = "_blank">

    <a class = "links" href = "http://sfussell.hci.cornell.edu/projects/projects.shtml" target = "_blank">
    Communication and Collaborative Technologies Lab</a>. I also worked as a representative for
    <a class = "links" href="https://wicc.acm.org" target = "_blank">Women in Computing at Cornell (WICC)</a>,
    and I was both webmaster and later Director of Public Relations for the co-ed service fraternity <a class = "links" href="http://www.apogamma.org/" target = "_blank">
    Alpha Phi Omega</a>. Additionally, I am an Arts and Sciences Peer Advisor, and I was a violinist in the
    <a class = "links" href="http://cuchamberorchestra.strikingly.com/" target = "_blank">Cornell Chamber Orchestra</a>.</p>
    <p>In my spare time, I enjoy
    exploring, volunteering, reading, and playing various instruments.</p>
